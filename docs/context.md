# Context

## Goal
- Build a personal 5/3/1 strength training tracker in Flutter for Android.

## Current State
- Flutter project initialized in `/Users/gukinhan/Desktop/todo-app/todo_app`.
- `lib/main.dart` contains a simple Todo app used for learning:
  - Add todo
  - Toggle completion
  - Delete item
  - Sort completed items to the bottom
- Debug banner disabled in `MaterialApp`.

## Key Files
- `lib/main.dart`: current learning app (Todo).
- `README.md`: renamed to `strength-531` with WIP goals.

## Git Status
- Git repo initialized and initial commits created:
  - `init flutter todo`
  - `update README for strength-531`
- Remote `origin` set to GitHub (user adjusted to preferred URL).

## Next Steps (Suggested)
- Replace Todo UI with 5/3/1 tracker screens.
- Decide local storage method (e.g., `shared_preferences` for MVP).
- Define MVP data model (workouts, sets/reps/weight, week progression).
